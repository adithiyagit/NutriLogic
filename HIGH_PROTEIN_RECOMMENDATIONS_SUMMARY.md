# 💪 High-Protein Meal Recommendations - NutriLogic

## 🎯 What Changed?

Your AI meal recommendation system now **heavily prioritizes HIGH-PROTEIN foods** while keeping fat and carbs low!

---

## ✅ Key Updates

### 1. **Minimum Protein Requirements**

#### For Weight Loss Goals (Obese/Overweight/Goal: Lose):
- ✅ **Minimum 10g protein per meal** (STRICT requirement)
- ✅ Maximum 30g fat per meal
- ✅ Maximum 80g carbs per meal

#### For Normal/Maintenance Goals:
- ✅ **Minimum 8g protein per meal** (STRICT requirement)
- ✅ Maximum 50g fat per meal
- ✅ Maximum 130g carbs per meal

---

### 2. **Smart Scoring System**

The recommendation algorithm now uses a **health score** that:

#### Weight Loss Mode:
```
Health Score = (Fat × 3.0) + (Carbs × 2.0) - (Protein × 5.0)
```
- **Fat penalized 3x** (avoid high-fat foods)
- **Carbs penalized 2x** (minimize carbs)
- **Protein rewarded 5x** (MASSIVELY favor high-protein foods!)

#### Normal Mode:
```
Health Score = (Fat × 1.5) + (Carbs × 1.0) - (Protein × 3.0)
```
- **Fat penalized 1.5x**
- **Carbs penalized 1x**
- **Protein rewarded 3x** (still heavily favored!)

**Lower score = Better meal** → High protein, low fat/carbs

---

### 3. **Protein-to-Calorie Ratio**

Meals are also sorted by **protein efficiency**:

```
Protein Ratio = (Protein / Calories) × 100
```

This ensures you get the most protein per calorie!

**Example:**
- Meal A: 20g protein, 300 calories → Ratio = 6.67%
- Meal B: 15g protein, 300 calories → Ratio = 5.0%
- **Meal A ranks higher!** ✅

### 4. **Visual Highlighting**

The protein information is now **prominently displayed**:

- 💪 **Green gradient background** for protein
- **Larger font size** (1.1em)
- **Bold white badge** with muscle emoji
- **First position** in nutrition info (above calories)

**Old Display:**
```
Calories: 250 kcal
Protein: 20g
Carbs: 30g
Fat: 10g
```

**New Display:**
```
💪 Protein: 20g 💪  <-- GREEN HIGHLIGHTED BOX
Calories: 250 kcal
Carbs: 30g
Fat: 10g
```

### 5. **Clear User Messaging**

#### For Weight Loss Users:
```
💪 High-Protein Smart Filtering Active!

Showing meals with HIGH PROTEIN (≥10g), 
LOW-FAT (≤30g) and LOW-CARB (≤80g)

✨ Optimized for muscle preservation, satiety, 
   and effective weight management
```

#### For Other Users:
```
💪 Protein-Focused Recommendations: 
All meals contain at least 8g of protein 
for optimal nutrition and muscle health
```
