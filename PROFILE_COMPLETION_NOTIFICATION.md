# 🔔 Profile Completion Notification System

## ✅ What's Been Added

A smart notification system that prompts users to complete their profile after login!

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **1. Automatic Detection**
When a user logs in, the system automatically checks if their profile is complete by verifying:
- ✅ Age
- ✅ Height
- ✅ Weight
- ✅ Gender

### **2. Smart Notification**
If any of these fields are missing, users will see a **prominent warning message** at the top of every page (except profile and logout pages):

```
⚠️ Please complete your profile with health details (age, height, weight, gender) 
to unlock all features and get personalized recommendations. 
[Update Profile Now] ← Clickable link
```

### **3. Session Management**
- The message appears **once per session** to avoid annoying users
- Automatically disappears after profile is completed
- Shows again in new sessions if profile is still incomplete

---

## 🎨 Message Appearance

**Visual Features:**
- 🟡 **Yellow warning alert** (Bootstrap alert-warning)
- ⚠️ **Warning icon** (Font Awesome triangle)
- 🔗 **Clickable link** to profile page
- ✖️ **Dismissible** (users can close it temporarily)
- 📍 **Left border accent** for emphasis
- 🌟 **Rounded corners** (rounded-4) for modern look
- 💫 **Shadow** for depth

---

## 📂 Implementation Files

### **1. Middleware** (`users/middleware.py`)
```python
class ProfileCompletionMiddleware:
    """Checks if user profile is complete after login"""
    - Runs on every request
    - Checks for missing fields
    - Shows warning if incomplete
    - Manages session state
```

### **2. Settings** (`nutrilogic/settings.py`)
```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...
    'users.middleware.ProfileCompletionMiddleware',  # ✅ Added
]
```

### **3. Base Template** (`users/templates/users/base.html`)
```html
<!-- Messages section with icons and styling -->
{% if messages %}
    <div class="alert ...">
        <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
        {{ message|safe }}  <!-- ✅ Allows HTML in messages -->
    </div>
{% endif %}
```

---

## 🔍 Exempted Pages

The notification **won't show** on these pages:
- `/profile/` (where users update their info)
- `/logout/` (logout page)
- `/admin/` (admin panel)

This prevents notification loops and improves UX!

## 💡 User Experience Flow

### **Scenario 1: New User**
1. User registers → Profile created with empty fields
2. User logs in → Sees warning message
3. User clicks "Update Profile Now"
4. User fills in age, height, weight, gender
5. User saves → Message disappears! ✅

### **Scenario 2: Existing User with Incomplete Profile**
1. User logs in → Sees warning message
2. User dismisses message (X button) → Gone temporarily
3. User navigates to another page → Message reappears
4. User completes profile → Message gone permanently! ✅

### **Scenario 3: User with Complete Profile**
1. User logs in → **No message** ✅
2. Full access to all features

## 🎨 Customization

### **Change Message Text:**
Edit `users/middleware.py`, line ~38:
```python
messages.warning(
    request,
    'Your custom message here with <a href="/profile/">link</a>',
    extra_tags='safe'
)
```

### **Change Required Fields:**
Edit `users/middleware.py`, line ~31:
```python
profile_incomplete = (
    not profile.age or 
    not profile.height or 
    not profile.weight or 
    not profile.gender or
    not profile.activity_level  # ← Add more fields
)
```

### **Change Exempt URLs:**
Edit `users/middleware.py`, line ~21:
```python
exempt_urls = [
    reverse('profile'),
    reverse('logout'),
    '/admin/',
    '/some-other-page/',  # ← Add more exemptions
]
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Middleware Execution:**
1. Request comes in
2. Middleware checks if user is authenticated
3. If yes, check if profile exists
4. If yes, check if current URL is exempt
5. If not exempt, check if profile is incomplete
6. If incomplete, show message (once per session)
7. Continue to view

### **Session Management:**
```python
# Store in session to avoid repeated messages
request.session['profile_incomplete_shown'] = True

# Reset happens automatically when:
# - User logs out (session cleared)
# - User updates profile (session continues, but check passes)
```
